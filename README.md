> In this Milestone, I performed the following actions;
  - Create a logic directory with 2 files
    - calculate.js
    - operate.js
  - Implement calculate.js module
    - Contain one default method calculate
    - Calculate method accepts calculator data object and button name as arguments
    - Calculator data object contains 3 properties

      - operation
    - The method uses the buttonName argument to mutate the calculator‚Äôs data object and return its modified version
  - Implement operate.js module

    - Implements default method operate
    - The operate function accepts the following as arguments
      - num1
      - num2
      - operation
    - Switch statement is use for switching between operation and performing the required math
    - Return result after each operation
 - Import calculate.js to the App component
 - Fix linter errors with the following commands
